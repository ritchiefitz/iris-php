, 'Hard Day'
, '2015-05-19'
, 'Well, today was the big day! Oh, I\'m exhausted. I think mostly from worrying so much. Managed to calm my nerves by writing a poem on the plane:<br /><br />Today is the day for thanks, food, and fun, But what do I do if I\'m nervous a ton? I just want it to be the greatest of days, But Sarah will be there forever in my gaze. Will she be happy? Will she be sad? Will Jack feel welcome and not feel so bad? Today will be fine, today will be grand, So stop all your worry and let this plane land!<br /><br />It\'s silly, but it helped keep me busy for a bit. Anyway, it went a lot better than I thought!! Thank goodness! The moment I knocked on Mom and Dad\'s with Jack\'s hand in mine was the most nervous I\'d been in a while! And I don\'t know why I was so nervous. I knew they\'d love him, and I knew he\'d love them, but it still scared me. I haven\'t brought someone home to meet the family in a long long time...<br /><br />Sarah ran downstairs to greet us right away, and she was beaming, so right away I let out a sigh of relief! Jack made a great first impression. Everyone loved the wine that we brought, and right away Mom and Sar-bear leaned in and said (not so quietly), "Jules, he\'s adorable!" Jack winked at me.<br /><br />The night went really well. I could see my sister getting sad a couple of times, but she composed herself very quickly and was right back in party mode. I\'ll talk more privately with her tomorrow when we go shopping, but I\'m just so glad that she seems okay with everything. And more importantly, I\'m glad Jack hasn\'t wanted to run away yet. ;)'

, 'Shopping with Sarah'
, '2015-05-20'
, 'I haven\'t had time to write the last couple of days because we\'ve been so busy! Friday, we went shopping, and even though it was super hectic, it\'s tradition, and it was fun! I talked more with Sarah, who was feeling a little more sad-or at least showing it more than Thursday. She just knows that the holidays are going to be a hard time for her this year, but that\'s completely understandable. She was even saying that she might come out to visit Jack and me in LA for a week or two, just to get away! I think that\'ll be fun. I really do miss her and don\'t get to see her nearly as often as we used to just because we\'re so busy. The rest of the weekend went well. Only a couple of awkward moments, like when it slipped that Jack and I were living together. I wasn\'t going to say anything until after Christmas (one thing at a time, I said!). It wasn\'t a huge deal-they knew we were serious-but I just didn\'t want to deal with any comments yet. It is a little soon, I guess, but it\'s right for us and we\'re so happy together. Anyway, it didn\'t seem to be so bad since they like Jack so much and think we work really well together. My mom pulled me aside last night and said, "Do you think he\'s \'The One\'?" I blushed about a million shades of pink and said, "Mom!"  which basically means, "yes" without me saying it. She gave me a hug and a kiss.  <br /><br />It was really hard to leave them. I miss home a lot, especially around the holidays. But LA is where my life is right now. I cried on the plane, and Jack comforted me and said that, now that he knows my family likes him and that he likes them, we can go back anytime I want! That made me smile. I feel so lucky to have him in my life and to have such an amazing family. What a perfect holiday to help remind me of this!!!'

, 'I can\'t believe it\'s already Thanksgiving! I do love this holiday, and I love fall, so I\'m excited to go back home where the leaves are changing and it\'s cold. I\'m nervous about bringing Jack home to meet everyone, though! He\'s going to be so overwhelmed, but I keep telling him that they\'re all going to love him. Which I know they will. I guess I\'m most worried about my sister, since she just got divorced. <br /><br />I\'m worried she\'ll feel lonely the whole weekend and won\'t want to hang out with us because she\'ll be the only one without a significant other. It almost makes me not want to bring Jack, so I can hang out with my sister the whole time and help her get through this.  But then again, that\'s not fair to Jack or myself. I want my sister to be happy, but I have to do what\'s right for me as well. I\'m sure it\'ll all work out. I just don\'t want her to be depressed the whole time. Man, this has always been my favorite holiday, but this year I can\'t wait for it to be over.'

, 'The Machine'
, '2015-05-22'
, 'As I watched the tube fill from a glossy yellow to a deep red, I felt less alive than ever. It entered the machine, whirring and spinning as if inconvenienced. Meanwhile, I sat there. At first it seemed like hours, and it slowly became hours. What felt like the entire day ticked by-as slowly as the red in the tube-while I stared at the machine. I could be called, at best, an accessory to this process. Most of the other people plugged into their own machines were older than me. If this is something that adults need, why do I have to be here? <br /><br />Today marks six months since I started hemodialysis. I had to start because I got really sick. I have always been more or less healthy, but the doctors told my parents that I have "chronic glomerulonephritis." You would think that word wouldn\'t be a part of a normal high school sophomore\'s vocabulary, and you\'d be right. Believe me, even though it\'s the biggest word I know, I wish I had never had to learn it. There\'s this big scientific explanation about what is going wrong with the various structures in my kidneys, but that isn\'t what I want to write here. If doctors can be relied upon for anything, certainly they can keep their own records. <br /><br />No, the important thing that you need to know is that the disease I have makes my kidneys almost useless. A year ago, I didn\'t even know what kidneys do, aside from vaguely resembling a disgusting bean that bears their name. It turns out, though, that your body uses its kidneys to filter out the waste left over from other bodily processes. You wouldn\'t think that "toxins" would be a significant label for very much in our bodies. Apparently, though, our bodily cells are cranking out toxic waste all day long.'

So, that\'s my problem: lots of toxins in my blood, and my kidneys are no longer filtering them out. That\'s why I have to get plugged into a dialyzer machine. Toxic blood goes in, but what else? Sometimes, I feel like the machine is sucking out who I am, too. Think about all of the people walking around with clean, non-dialysis-filtered blood. How many of them are even aware that their kidneys are keeping them alive? Maybe one percent? And that\'s being generous. I, however, have learned way more than I ever wanted to about exactly how the bean-shaped organs keep the toxins out of everyone\'s veins and arteries. Everyone\'s veins, it seems, but mine.'

, 'Super Sick'
, '2015-05-22'
, 'If it weren\'t for the machine, I would die. I remember my first time. I had been feeling very sick for a while, so I guess I was pretty hopeful. Yeah, I felt better afterward. But I had to go back again. And again. And again. For six months. I may even have to keep going back for my entire life, or what\'s left of it. What kind of life do you have when you need to be plugged into a machine that performs an incredibly slow process that most people don\'t even know exists. Sometimes I ask myself, “Is it worth it?"<br /><br />
What I have learned from this is who I am and what is really important to me. I don\'t know what the life expectancy is for people who have chronic kidney failure, but I can\'t imagine it keeps pace with the life expectancies of normal people. This realization, while terrifying, has pushed me to write down my dreams, my fears, and my innermost thoughts. Ever since I could scrawl out little more than my name in crayon, I have always felt a pull toward writing, as if it were my life\'s calling. It is, perhaps, the only way to experience who I really am-for other people as well as myself. In expounding my most personal self on paper, I hope to find both strength and meaning. Sincerely written, the events of our lives can transform into digestible lessons that nourish our souls\' growth. It could be that someone else who is suffering as I am might take solace in my writing. I certainly hope it helps them, because that process could never be performed by a machine.'

, 'Alice: The Real Story'
, '2015-05-22'
, 'Today I found a lot of books at the library on Lewis Carroll and read some more interesting things I had no idea about! The thing I\'m most interested in right now is the real Alice that his Alice books are based on. She was a real little girl named Alice Liddell, whom Lewis had befriended, along with the rest of her family. He would take the children on various boating trips and tell them stories, which he then incorporated into his books. <br /><br />What fun that must have been for the children to hear such a great story teller! I also saw some photographs that Lewis took of the real Alice. She isn\'t a little blond girl like in the illustrations or movies, she has short brown hair, and some of the pictures are kind of provocative even. I know from my research so far that there is speculation on the idea that Lewis was in love with Alice, but after reading more, I don\'t think that at all. <br /><br />I just think that he was a child at heart himself and wanted to play dress up and photograph his friends. It\'s all really interesting, especially for the time period (the 1850s primarily). I wish I could have been a fly on the wall in his studio! Over the next few weeks I plan on doing more research on his friendship with the Liddell family and his relationship with his father. These are the aspects of his life that interest me the most so far.'

, 'My paper has been coming along great so far! I\'m not worried so much about structure right now, because I\'m still doing research and think that once I know exactly where I want my paper to go, it\'ll basically write itself. I reread both Alice books along with some other things that Lewis Carroll has written. <br /><br />He is such a fun author to read that I could read his books all day! I\'m learning a lot about how to write a research paper during this process. At first it all seemed so overwhelming to me that I didn\'t know where to start. But, with help from teachers and friends, I\'ve learned that it can be a lot of fun if you work little by little and don\'t wait until the last minute.  I\'ve been able to find a lot of information at the library, along with websites. <br /><br />But it\'s tricky online because you have to make sure it\'s a credible source and not just a crazy person writing something they think they know a lot about. I would love to be able to dig deeper into Lewis\'s life, but I haven\'t had time to focus on everything! I realized that there is enough on just the Alice books for me to write a long enough paper, and I can continue my own research after the paper is due, if I\'m still interested! I never thought I\'d be doing non-school related research for my own pleasure, but it\'s just so cool! I\'m glad we were able to choose our own author, because that made me more excited to do the project in the first place. I think I chose well, because Lewis Carroll has a lot of characteristics that I can relate to. I can\'t wait to get feedback on my writing and tell others what I\'ve learned!'
